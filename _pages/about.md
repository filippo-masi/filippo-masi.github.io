Since late 2022, I joined the Sydney Centre in Geomechanics and Mining Materials (SciGEM) @ The University of Sydney, as Postdoctoral Research Associate.

I studied at the School of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Florence (Italy) and did my thesis jointly at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France), in collaboration with the University of Versailles and St-Quentin and the enterprise Ingerop.
My research concerns the development of data-driven and machine learning approaches for the constitutive modeling of materials, the structural and fast-dynamic behavior of masonry structures, geomechanics, and hydrodynamics.
